# WEEK -2 TASK

objective

To port the Contiki-NG operating system to the EFR32ZG28 (ARM Cortex-M33) microcontroller and successfully run and build a basic Contiki example (hello-world) on this platform.

outcome

Successfully set up the Contiki-NG environment and toolchain on Ubuntu.

Created and configured a new platform folder for EFR32ZG28, including source files and build configurations.

Integrated startup code, linker script, and CMSIS headers from the Gecko SDK.

Implemented essential hardware abstraction files (UART, clock, rtimer).

Built and verified the hello-world example for the native target.

Build system is correctly set up; the target-specific build (hello-world.efr32zg28) is in progress.

Project is 90% complete; only final binary generation is pending due to a minor Makefile linkage issue
