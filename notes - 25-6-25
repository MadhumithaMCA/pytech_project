1. Understanding about the OSI Model

7 OSI Layers:

    Physical Layer

    Data Link Layer

    Network Layer

    Transport Layer

    Session Layer

    Presentation Layer

    Application Layer

        Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, NFS, SMTP, DHCP, SNMP, TELNET, POP3, IRC, NNTP

Why OSI is Important?

    OSI → Open System Interconnection

    It is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for communication using standard protocols.

Key Points:

    The internet does not follow the OSI model strictly.

    It is useful for troubleshooting network problems.

    The OSI model breaks down the problem and helps to locate trouble and solve issues.

Application Layer (Layer 7)

    Request → Web Server → Response

    It is the only layer that directly interacts with users.

    Protocols used:

        HTTP, SMTP, FTP, NFS, DHCP, SNMP, TELNET, POP3, IRC, NNTP

    Functions:

        File transfer

        Web browsing

        Email

        Virtual terminals

Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

    Handles:

        Character/Number encoding

        Encryption → Compression (bits reduction) → Translation

    Responsibilities:

        Prepares data received from the application layer for transmission.

        Handles data translation, encryption, and compression.

Session Layer (Layer 5)

    Manages session of communication between two devices.

    Responsibilities:

        Opens and closes communication sessions.

        Maintains the time duration between opening and closing of a session.

Transport Layer (Layer 4)

    Handles:

        Segmentation → Transport → Reassembly

    Ensures complete data transfer and reliability.

    Responsible for end-to-end communication between devices.

    Protocols used:

        TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

        UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

3. Network Layer

    Handles:

        Packet Creation → Transport → Packet Assembly

    Responsible for data transfer between two networks.

    Protocols used:

        ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

        IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol)

2. Data Link Layer

    Handles:

        Frame Creation → Transport → Transfer Frames between networks

    Similar to the network layer, but:

        It takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller frames for transmission.

1. Physical Layer

    Transfers raw bitstreams over the physical medium.

    Example:
    [ ] ——— 0010100010 ———> Receiving Cable
    (Sending Cable → Receiving Cable)

Physical Layer 

    Includes physical equipment such as:

        Cables

        Switches

    The data transmitted at this layer is in the form of 0s and 1s.

    Responsible for transmitting bits over wires/hardware.

OSI Layers and Their Functions

    Application Layer (Layer 7)

        User-facing layer

        Handles protocols like:

            HTTP, FTP, DNS

    Presentation Layer (Layer 6)

        Responsible for:

            Formatting, encryption, compression

        Examples:

            JPEG, TLS, ASCII

    Session Layer (Layer 5)

        Manages session control

        Examples:

            NetBIOS, SMB

    Transport Layer (Layer 4)

        Ensures end-to-end connection

        Protocols:

            TCP, UDP

    Network Layer (Layer 3)

        Handles routing and IP addressing

        Protocols:

            IP, ICMP

    Data Link Layer (Layer 2)

        Ensures frame delivery

        Protocols:

            Ethernet, ARP, PPP

    Physical Layer (Layer 1)

        Transmits bits via hardware

        Media:

            Cables, radio, Wi-Fi, signals


State Machine

State Machine / FSM (Finite State Machine) is a programming model consisting of:

    A set of states

    Transitions between states based on events

    Execution of specific actions in each state

Definition:

A computational model representing a system with a finite number of states.
Basic Components:

    State – Different steps or modes of operation (e.g., Idle, Sending)

    Transitions – Method of moving between different states (e.g., one state to another)

    Actions (Events/Triggers) – Events or changes that occur during the execution of the state machine

Examples:

    Elevator system:

        States: Going up, Going down, Open/close door

    Traffic Lights:

        Transition between Red, Green, Yellow

        Triggered by timers

    Software Systems:

        Used in user interfaces, game logic

    Network Protocols

        Use FSMs for predictable packet handling and communication

Benefits:

    Provides an organized representation of complex logic

    Ensures predictable behavior

    Promotes modularity

    Reduces complexity in system design


Finite State Machine – Diagram Explanation

    It is used for modeling and managing the dynamic behavior of various systems using a Finite State Machine (FSM).

Example: Door State Machine

[1] door opened
   ↑         ↓
 open     close
   ↓         ↑
[2] door closed

Components in the Diagram:

    States:

        door opened

        door closed

    Transitions:

        open (from closed to opened)

        close (from opened to closed)

    Transition condition: Based on input events like opening or closing

    Entry action: For example, when entering the "door closed" state
